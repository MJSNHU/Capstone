# Introduction
This github repository holds my Capstone project for the University of Southern New Hampshire's CS-499 course which completes my bachelor's of computer science degree. The purpose of this project was to enhance existing project artifacts from the degree program in three categories: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structure, and databases. A code review of the initial artifact and planned enhancements was also required.

A video of my code review can be found here: [Code Review - YouTube](https://youtu.be/XsEBWYWNU5w)

This capstone course had five outcomes to demonstrate:

* Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
* Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
* Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
* Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
* Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources


# Self Assessment


# Initial Artifact
The original artifact used for all three enhancements is from my final project in a course I took at Southern New Hampshire University in October2024: CS-360, Mobile Architecture and Programming. In this project, I developed an Android mobile application in Java that allowed the user to create and save events into a database, review and edit them.  I selected this artifact because I wanted to improve my mobile application programming skills.
