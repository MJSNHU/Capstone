# Enhancement 1

For enhancement one, software design/engineering, I translated the code into the Kotlin programming language and added a search functionality.  This shows of course objective four to  “demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.” 

Although many development companies focus on one or just a few programming languages, by demonstrating I can produce content in multiple languages shows my ability to understand the fundamentals of the application and languages, and my flexibility and capability to pick up new languages and technologies. Although Java use may be more widespread than Kotlin, since Google adopted Kotlin as a primary language for Android applications, familiarity with the language will improve my value as an employee as more software companies develop mobile applications for their products. Specifically, as an aspiring penetration tester, mobile applications may provide access to protected data as more and more users bring their own devices to work on an office’s infrastructure and should be tested for vulnerabilities.

Before this enhancement I had never used Kotlin, so I learned a great deal about its syntax and conventions. Kotlin supports inferred typing rather than requiring explicit specification like in Java, so in some cases I was able to streamline code, making it more readable.  In translating the project, I moved from SQLite database conventions in Java to Room in Kotlin, making it easier to interact with the database.  Through the use of a higher-level API: rather than creating individual SQL instructions to create the database and tables, I annotated Entities and created interfaces through Data Access Objects.
