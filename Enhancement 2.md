# Enhancement 2

In this enhancement, algorithms and data structures, I implementing a binary search tree with a switch that allows the tree to be built in order of date or event name.  The traversal function is the same for both switches, so I only needed to add a simple if statement to the insertion algorithm to accomplish this enhancement.

Recognizing how to add type sorting functionality to a basic binary search tree function demonstrates a firm understanding how to augment a binary search tree without writing a completely new algorithm or detracting from its intended functionality.  This met the course objective to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.

I was pleasantly surprised how a simple solution could elegantly enhance the basic functionality of a binary search tree by implementing a switch to change the order of the tree between by date and by event name.  By adding an if statement and including a parameter switch, the tree could be ordered in different ways when it was built, rather than creating redundant code to produce a near identical data structure.  A major challenge was in translating the tree into a list view in the application.  If the tree wasn’t built, I still had to query the database, and this required sorting through and accessing the contexts of the different threads to pass the information from a query to the activity layout.  By implementing a local in-memory binary search tree, I was able to access and store the data in one context and use it in another.  Reusing the in-memory data structure allowed me to avoid switching contexts when it wasn’t necessary.
